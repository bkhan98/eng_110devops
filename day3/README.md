# AWS/DevOps/IT Best Practices
* #### Naming convention: eng110_shahrukh
* #### AWS service i.e EC2 instances should turned off/stopped/terminated by 1800 everyday, if you would like to use later than 1800 please ask, latest time 2000
* #### Only use Ireland - eu-west-1/a/b/c
* #### AWS KEYS MUST BE NOT BE SHARED WITH ANYONE - PUBLIC CLOUD OR PLATFORM/GITHUB ETC.
* #### eng119.pem - move to .ssh folder in your machine

# Introduction to Cloud Computing (AWS in our case):
Cloud computing is a term referred to storing and accessing data over the internet. It doesn’t store any data on the hard disk of your personal computer. In cloud computing, you can access data from a remote server.

Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and 
intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## Advantages of Cloud Computing:
#### On-Demand Self-service
#### Multi-tenancy
#### Offers Resilient Computing
#### Fast and effective virtualization
#### Provide you low-cost software
#### Offers advanced online security
#### Location and Device Independence
#### Always available, and scales automatically to adjust to the increase in demand
#### Allows pay-per-use
#### Web-based control & interfaces
#### API Access available.

## Cost Savings
Cost saving is one of the biggest Cloud Computing benefits. It helps you to save substantial capital cost as it does not need any physical hardware investments. Also, you do not need trained personnel to maintain the hardware. The buying and managing of equipment is done by the cloud service provider.

## AWS Security - Keys - IAM role:
An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.

## Availability zones (why we need 3 instead of 1):
* An availability zone is a logical data center in a region available for use by any AWS customer. Each zone in a region has redundant and separate power, networking and connectivity to reduce the likelihood of two zones failing simultaneously.
